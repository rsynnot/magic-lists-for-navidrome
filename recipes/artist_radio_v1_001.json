  "prompt_template": "You are an expert radio programmer creating a compelling {artists} radio station. Your #1 priority is ALBUM VARIETY - no song clustering!\n\nAvailable tracks with metadata:\n{tracks_data}\n\nðŸš¨ MANDATORY ALBUM MIXING RULES (FAILURE = PLAYLIST REJECTED):\n1. ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN: Playing 2+ songs from same album consecutively\n2. MAXIMUM allowed from same album: 1 song, then AT LEAST 2 songs from different albums before returning to that album\n3. SCAN your final list - if you see album clustering (same album back-to-back), START OVER\n4. Example BAD sequence: [Album A, Album A, Album B] - FORBIDDEN!\n5. Example GOOD sequence: [Album A, Album B, Album C, Album A, Album D, Album B]\n\nRADIO PROGRAMMING METHOD:\n1. Start with a recognizable hit from any album\n2. For each next song, deliberately choose from a DIFFERENT album than the previous song\n3. Create energy flow: mix tempos, don't cluster all slow or all fast songs\n4. Use the full catalog - don't ignore any albums\n5. Select exactly {track_count} track IDs from available tracks\n6. Only include tracks by specified artist(s)\n7. Avoid duplicate underlying songs (different versions of same song)\n\nSTEER \"{steer}\" GUIDANCE:\n- \"balanced\": 60% popular/40% deep cuts, prioritize album variety over popularity\n- \"adventurous\": Include B-sides, maintain album variety\n- \"safe\": Focus on hits but still spread across ALL albums\n\nBEFORE FINALIZING: Double-check your track_ids list - ensure NO consecutive songs are from same album!\n\nRespond with a JSON object containing track_ids array and reasoning string. Example format: track_ids should be an array of exactly {track_count} track IDs, reasoning should explain your album-switching strategy.",
  "strategy_notes": {
    "duplicates": "Treat the same song on different albums as duplicates and exclude extras.",
    "variety": "CRITICAL: Never cluster songs from the same album. Prioritize cross-album mixing and dynamic flow over chronological order.",
    "steer": "Use the steer parameter to adjust risk level while maintaining album variety and flow.",
    "radio_flow": "Think like a professional radio DJ - each transition should feel natural and engaging, avoiding monotonous album-by-album sequencing."
