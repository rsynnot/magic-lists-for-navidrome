# MagicLists for Navidrome

**AI-assisted playlists for your own music library.**

MagicLists adds the kind of curated, evolving playlists you‚Äôd expect from Spotify or Apple Music‚Äîexcept it works entirely on your self-hosted Navidrome server. No subscriptions, no renting your music back. Just smart mixes generated from the library you already own.

## What it does
- üéµ **This Is (Artist)** ‚Äî Builds a definitive playlist for any artist in your library, combining hits, deep cuts, and featured appearances without duplicates.
- üîÑ **Re-Discover** ‚Äî Rotates tracks you haven‚Äôt played in a while, helping you fall back in love with your collection.
- ‚è∞ **Auto-Refresh** ‚Äî Keep playlists fresh with daily, weekly, or monthly updates.
- üê≥ **Quick Setup** ‚Äî Simple Docker install; get started in minutes.

## Why it matters
Navidrome users already own their music. MagicLists brings modern curation tools into that world‚Äîso your playlists feel alive, not static, and your collection keeps surprising you.

## Who‚Äôs behind it
I‚Äôm Ricky, a product designer with 20+ years in tech. I‚Äôm building MagicLists feature by feature, from UI and CSS to playlist logic, because I‚Äôm passionate about open-source, privacy-friendly music tools. This isn‚Äôt vaporware or a throwaway experiment‚Äîit‚Äôs genuine, ongoing research into how AI can enrich personal music libraries.

## What‚Äôs next
Upcoming experiments include:
- Multi-artist ‚Äúradio‚Äù blends
- Decade and discovery-focused lists
- Creative journeys like The Long Way Home (a track-to-track sonic path) and Genre Archaeology (tracing influences backwards through time).

MagicLists is just getting started, and I‚Äôd love your feedback as it grows.

## Installation

### Recommended: Add to Your Existing Docker Compose

**Why this method?** Your MagicLists container will be on the same network as Navidrome, making connection simple and reliable. This also enables future features like audio analysis that require local file access.

1. **Add MagicLists to your existing `docker-compose.yml`** (the one that runs Navidrome):
```yaml
   services:
     navidrome:
       # ... your existing Navidrome config ...
     
     magiclists:
       image: rickysynnot/magic-lists-for-navidrome:latest
       container_name: magiclists
       ports:
         - "4545:8000"
       environment:
         - NAVIDROME_URL=http://navidrome:4533
         - NAVIDROME_USERNAME=your_username
         - NAVIDROME_PASSWORD=your_password
         - DATABASE_PATH=/app/data/magiclists.db # Required: Database location
         - AI_PROVIDER=groq                    # Optional: groq, ollama, or openrouter
         - AI_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key        # Optional, for Groq/OpenRouter
         - AI_MODEL=llama-3.1-8b-instant       # Optional, for AI providers
       volumes:
         - ./magiclists-data:/app/data          # Persist configuration
       restart: unless-stopped
```
2. Update the environment variables with your Navidrome credentials
3. Start the stack:
```bash
   docker-compose up -d
```
4. Access MagicLists at http://localhost:4545

Note: The NAVIDROME_URL uses the container name (navidrome) as the hostname. If your Navidrome service has a different name in your compose file, update this accordingly.

### Alternative: Standalone Docker Container
Use this if you can't or don't want to modify your existing Docker Compose setup.

**If Navidrome is publicly accessible:**
Use your public Navidrome URL (e.g., https://music.yourdomain.com):
```bash
   docker run -d \
      --name magiclists \
      -p 4545:8000 \
      -e NAVIDROME_URL=https://music.yourdomain.com \
      -e NAVIDROME_USERNAME=your_username \
      -e NAVIDROME_PASSWORD=your_password \
      -e DATABASE_PATH=/app/data/magiclists.db \
      -e AI_PROVIDER=groq \
      -e AI_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key \
      -v ./magiclists-data:/app/data \
      rickysynnot/magic-lists-for-navidrome:latest
```

**If Navidrome is on the same host machine:**
Use host.docker.internal to reach services on your host:
```bash
   docker run -d \
      --name magiclists \
      -p 4545:8000 \
      -e NAVIDROME_URL=http://host.docker.internal:4533 \
      -e NAVIDROME_USERNAME=your_username \
      -e NAVIDROME_PASSWORD=your_password \
      -e DATABASE_PATH=/app/data/magiclists.db \
      -e AI_PROVIDER=groq \
      -e AI_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key \
      -v ./magiclists-data:/app/data \
      rickysynnot/magic-lists-for-navidrome:latest
```
**If Navidrome is on your local network:**
Use the local IP address of the machine running Navidrome:
```bash
   docker run -d \
      --name magiclists \
      -p 4545:8000 \
      -e NAVIDROME_URL=http://192.168.1.100:4533 \
      -e NAVIDROME_USERNAME=your_username \
      -e NAVIDROME_PASSWORD=your_password \
      -e DATABASE_PATH=/app/data/magiclists.db \
      -e AI_PROVIDER=groq \
      -e AI_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key \
      -v ./magiclists-data:/app/data \
      rickysynnot/magic-lists-for-navidrome:latest
```
Access MagicLists at http://localhost:4545

   NAVIDROME_URL=http://localhost:4533
   NAVIDROME_USERNAME=your_username
   NAVIDROME_PASSWORD=your_password
   DATABASE_PATH=./magiclists.db        # Required: Database location
   AI_PROVIDER=groq                    # Optional: groq, ollama, or openrouter
   AI_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key        # Optional, for Groq/OpenRouter
   AI_MODEL=llama-3.1-8b-instant       # Optional, for AI providers
```
5. Run the application:
```bash
    python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4545
```
6. Access the application at http://localhost:4545
To update: Simply `git pull` and restart the application.

## Troubleshooting

### Database Write Errors (500 Server Error)
If system checks pass but playlist creation fails with a 500 error about database write permissions:

**Solution**: Ensure `DATABASE_PATH` environment variable is set:
- **Docker**: `DATABASE_PATH=/app/data/magiclists.db` (with volume mounted to `/app/data`)
- **Standalone**: `DATABASE_PATH=./magiclists.db` (in your project directory)

This is **required** for the application to persist playlist data and user settings.

### Connection Issues

Can't connect to Navidrome? The most common issue is an incorrect `NAVIDROME_URL`. Here's how to determine the right value:
- Same Docker network: Use the container name (e.g., http://navidrome:4533)
- Same host machine: Use http://host.docker.internal:4533 (Docker Desktop) or http://172.17.0.1:4533 (Linux)
- Different machine on LAN: Use the local IP (e.g., http://192.168.1.100:4533)
- Public internet: Use your domain (e.g., https://music.yourdomain.com)

**Check if containers are on the same network:**
```bash
   # List Docker networks
   docker network ls

   # Inspect your network
   docker network inspect your_network_name

   # Verify both containers are on the same network
   docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Networks}}"
```

**No artists found**
   - Ensure your music library is scanned in Navidrome
   - Check Navidrome logs for scanning issues
   - If using multiple libraries, verify the library ID is correct

**Database errors**
   - Ensure write permissions for database directory
   - Check disk space
   - Restart the application if database appears corrupted

**Still having issues?** Check the System Check page in the app after startup - it will test your connection and provide specific guidance.


## System Check Page 

MagicLists automatically validates your configuration on startup. If any issues are detected, you'll be redirected to a system check page that shows:

- **Environment Variables**: Checks that required variables are set
- **Navidrome URL**: Verifies your server is reachable  
- **Navidrome Authentication**: Tests your credentials
- **Navidrome Artists API**: Confirms API access is working
- **AI Provider**: Checks if AI features are configured (Groq, Ollama, or OpenRouter)
- **Library Configuration**: Shows multiple library setup status

If checks fail, detailed suggestions are provided to help resolve issues. You can also access the system check at any time via `/system-check`.

## AI Configuration (Optional)

MagicLists supports multiple AI providers for enhanced playlist curation:

1. **Fallback-only** (Free) - Uses play count and metadata sorting
2. **Groq** (Free) - Fast cloud models with no credit card required
3. **Local LLM** (Free) - Run models locally with Ollama
4. **OpenRouter Free Models** (Free) - Access to free cloud models
5. **OpenRouter Premium Models** (Paid) - Higher quality cloud models

### Option 1: Groq (Recommended - Fast & Free)
Get a free API key from [Groq](https://console.groq.com/) - no credit card required:

```bash
# .env configuration
AI_PROVIDER=groq
AI_API_KEY=gsk_your-groq-key-here
AI_MODEL=llama-3.1-8b-instant           # Fast default model
# AI_MODEL=mixtral-8x7b-32768           # Alternative model
```

### Option 2: Ollama (Local Models)
[Install Ollama](https://ollama.com) and run models locally:

```bash
# Install and run a model
ollama pull llama3.2
ollama serve

# .env configuration
AI_PROVIDER=ollama
AI_MODEL=llama3.2
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions
# For Docker: OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434/v1/chat/completions
# OLLAMA_TIMEOUT=300  # Increase for slower CPUs (default: 180 seconds)
```

### Option 3: OpenRouter (Cloud Models)
Get an API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) ($5 minimum):

```bash
# .env configuration
AI_PROVIDER=openrouter
AI_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-your-key-here
AI_MODEL=deepseek/deepseek-chat         # Free model
# AI_MODEL=anthropic/claude-3-haiku     # Paid model
```

**Note:** Without AI configuration, the app falls back to play-count based playlist generation.


## Multiple Navidrome Libraries
   
If you have multiple music libraries in Navidrome:

- **Automatic**: MagicLists will detect and work with all libraries by default
- **Specific Library**: Set `NAVIDROME_LIBRARY_ID` to target a specific library:
   ```bash
   NAVIDROME_LIBRARY_ID=your-library-id-here
   ```
- **Find Library IDs**: Check your Navidrome admin interface or API documentation
- **System Check**: The health check will show library configuration status
